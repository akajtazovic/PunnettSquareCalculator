	<h1>Punnett Square Calculator: Brown Hair Edition</h1>
	<pre>
		Team Members: Amajla (Just me).

		Application Overview: It is an application that uses the punnett square method to 
		predict if the user's baby will have a likely possibility of brown hair. It then displays a congratulation message if the possibility is over 50%. The percentage of possibility is shown. When the user exits, a farewell message is shown.

		Technology Overview: I used purely Java for this project. The libraries I utilized are Graphics, Color, Font, JLabel, JFrame, JPanel, WindowEvent, WindowListener, and Scanner. Platforms that are needed are simply a terminal.

		Proposal Last Updated: April 13th 2022.

		Feature List:
		- Gives a percentage based on Punnett Square Method.
		- Shows a Congratulations message when probability is over 50% percent.
		- Ends the program and instructs user to restart when incorrect letters are 
		typed.

		Future Feature List:
		- Implementing more than one hair color into the program (blonde hair, red hair, etc.)
		- Drawing brown hair on the face in the congratulations message.

		Basic Technical Features:
		- Gives a percentage based on Punnett Square Method.
		- Shows a Congratulations message when probability is over 50% percent.
		- Ends the program and instructs user to restart when incorrect letters are 
		typed.
		- Uses inheritance.
